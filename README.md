**Evaluation**
Predictions are then made on the test set using the predict method. The evaluation metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared, are calculated to assess the model's performance.
-evaluation of linear regression:
The result you provided includes three evaluation metrics commonly used in machine learning regression tasks: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) score.
    1.MSE (Mean Squared Error): The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values in a regression problem. In your case, the MSE value of 1.0452173921638228e-26 indicates an extremely small mean squared error. A smaller MSE value indicates better accuracy of the regression model in predicting the target variable.
    2.RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): The RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a more interpretable measure of the average prediction error. The RMSE value of 1.0223587394666428e-13 is also very small, indicating a very low average prediction error. Like the MSE, a smaller RMSE value indicates better accuracy of the regression model.
    3.	R-squared (R^2) score: The R^2 score represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that can be explained by the independent variables (features) in the regression model. A perfect R^2 score is 1.0, which means that the model can explain all the variability in the target variable. In my case, the R^2 score of 1.0 indicates that the regression model is able to perfectly predict the target variable.
    4.Bias :
    The intercept provides valuable information about the baseline or starting point of the regression model. It captures the inherent value of the dependent variable when there is no influence from the independent variables.
The interpretation of the intercept depends on the specific problem and the nature of the variables involved. Here are a few possible interpretations:
    1.	In a simple linear regression model with one independent variable, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. For example, in a regression model predicting housing prices based on square footage, the intercept could represent the base price of a house with zero square footage.
2.	In a multiple linear regression model with multiple independent variables, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all the independent variables are zero. It captures the constant term that contributes to the prediction of the dependent variable. For example, in a regression model predicting sales based on advertising expenditure and store size, the intercept could represent the baseline sales that are not influenced by advertising or store size.
3.	The intercept can also be interpreted as the error term or unexplained variation in the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It captures factors that are not accounted for by the available predictors.
    5.reg.coef:
    In the context of a linear regression model, the intercept (also known as the bias term) represents the estimated value of the dependent variable (the target variable) when all independent variables (features) are set to zero. It is the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis.

    6. Rsquare:
    In the given code snippet, reg.score(X_test, y_test) calculates the R-squared (coefficient of determination) score of the regression model on the test set. R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (y) that is predictable from the independent variables (X) in the model.
•	0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable.
•	1 indicates that the model explains all of the variability in the dependent variable.

In summary, the results suggest that the regression model has achieved very high accuracy and is able to predict the target variable with minimal error, as evidenced by the extremely low MSE and RMSE values. Additionally, the perfect R^2 score indicates that the model explains all the variability in the target variable, suggesting a very good fit to the data.

Important idea: The difference between linear regression and Ridge regression
Overall, Ridge regression is a modification of linear regression that addresses multicollinearity and overfitting issues. By adding a regularization term, it provides more stable and reliable coefficient estimates and helps prevent overfitting. However, Ridge regression introduces a bias in the coefficient estimates, as the coefficients are pushed towards zero. The appropriate choice of the regularization parameter is crucial in balancing the trade-off between bias and variance in the model.
